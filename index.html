            <h2>Choosing How We Respond to What's Happening Now</h2>
            <p>Have you ever stopped and asked yourself, am I really not causing my own problems? Maybe so, maybe not. Some problems just come into our lives just like that. And we can't do anything about it. But the way we respond to those problems set the tone. Whether we will come out of that problem, or if there will come another problem after that.</p> 

            <section>
            <h3>Lacking</h3> 
            <p>It's easy to look around and notice what you don't have or what you want. Sometimes it doesn't even require you looking aorund. It's just evident. And that is life. Nothing unusual about it. We all have something we lack and hope to get it. But lacking something isn't how can I say it, a pathway into this state of void and feeling of being incomplete to the point you feel like you have nothing. When you start seeing that lacking as something that is hard to obtain or can't even obtain it due to feeling unworthy or incapable of doing it, that's when things start going south. 
                <br>In my <abbr title="Ordinary">
                    <a href="https://qualifications.pearson.com/en/support/support-topics/understanding-our-qualifications/our-qualifications-explained/about-o-levels.html">O'level</a></abbr> years, I remember feeling like I lacked a lot of things. I lacked friends, I lacked confidence, I lacked comfort, I lacked joy. All this put me in such a dark place where I felt like I had nothing to offer. All because of what, I saw kids we studied together in primary that were just living their best lives in good schools with braided hair unlike my bold head at the time. I felt like I lacked a lot of things and that made me feel like I had nothing.

            <h3>Complaining</h3>

                    <strong>Complaining about what you lack</strong>
                    <p>
                    <code>When you focus on what you lack, you create a narrative of scarcity.</code>

            <p>When you have already established that you lack something, <em>tayali complaining</em>. If I tell you I was the master of complaining, believe it. It started off small. Why do I have to wake up so early? Why do I have to study so hard to get what I want? Why do I have to be known as the little sister to so and so? I have a name. But after all that I saw the fruit in all those things I was complaining about. I got better grades than those who were sleeping while I was studying, I wnet to great school better than those who were so called being the first all the time, I actually look back and see how my life was easy and fun because I was known as the sister of so and so. When I saw all that was happening to me I was so happy that I thought I would never ever lack a thing. <strong>But I never stopped complaining not even for a single day.</strong>
            <ul>
                <li>I wanted to go to Gashora
                <address>RN15</address>
                <figure>

                </figure>
                <li>I wanted to braid my hair despite my dad being against it since I was in nursery. I got it.</li>
                <li>I wanted to loose weight after COVID. I lost it.</li>
                <li>I wanted to get a job after high school. I got it.</li>
                <li>I wanted to join a great university. I got it.</li>
                <li>I wanted to join a dancing troop. I did it.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>But after all these things I dreamt about and got those stuff, did it stop me from complaining, not even a bit. I got into PCB but it was too hard for me, too demanding, I don't want it anymore. My hair was braided but it was good like others. I lost weight but just not enough. I got a job but it's too draining. I went to a great university but they don't teach that great. I joined a dancing troop but it's hard, it's far, I don't have the money. Complain, complain, complain.

            <p>After all that complaining, I was still in the same place I was before. Lacking. I lacked peace, I lacked joy, I lacked fulfillment, I lacked purpose. I was still in that dark place I was before. I had nothing to offer. I was still incomplete. Until one day I woke up and said enough is enough. I can't keep living like this. I need to change something. I need to change my mindset. I need to stop complaining and start creating. I started small. I started appreciating what I had. I started being grateful for the little things. I started focusing on what I can do rather than what I can't do. I started setting small goals for myself and achieving them. I started creating a vision for my life and working towards it.
            <ol> 
                <li>If I wanted to have great hair, I started to start small trim bit by bit until I have that healthy hair.</li> 
                <li>If I wanted to be fit, stop eating junk food all the time. </li>
            </ol>
            <br>If I wanted to be happy, I started doing things that made me happy. I started creating a life that I wanted to live rather than complaining about the life I had.
            <p>Choosing how we respond to current events is a powerful thing. We can either complain about what we lack or create what we want. It's all about mindset. It's all about perspective. It's all about taking action. So, the next time you find yourself in a situation where you feel like you lack something, ask yourself, am I going to complain about it or am I going to create a solution? The choice is yours.</p>
